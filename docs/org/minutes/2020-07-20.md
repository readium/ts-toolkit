## Discussion

* current work
* injecting Readium CSS
* browser compatibility

### Notes

Jiminy's current work 
- Shared models in Readium Web: https://github.com/readium/web/pull/3 -> received comments from Mickaël
- Navigator in JBKS fork: https://github.com/Jellybooks/web/pull/1 -> WIP

Navigator: idea is to simplify things a little bit e.g. PaginationView is very app-centric (webviews, scrollview, etc. in Swift) and doesn’t necessarily work that well with iframes.

The injection of Readium CSS is made client side in Aferdita's apps, without any visual "glitch". In the Bokbasen case, the iframe is written with a type, from obfuscated content. Injection of Readium CSS is done before the iframe is reported as finished loading. When a resize happens, user settings (columns) have to be re-applied. 

Discussion around using srcDoc (input as HTML, not XHTML -> blocker for Juan).

Proposal Juan, create a DOM in memory, manipulate the head, then make it a blob url as XHTML, point the browser to that.

We'll have to be careful about the limitation we create on browsers, as there are old browsers in education. 

| Browser       | Min. Version | Comments                        |
| --------      | --------     | --------                        |
| Chrome        | 49+          | First version with full ES6     |
| IE            | None         | no CSS Variables                |
| Edge (Legacy) | Yes/no?      | Leaning towards no... *         |
| Edge (Chrome) | Yes!         |                                 |
| Safari        | 11           |                                 |
| Firefox       | Y            |                                 |

(*) No [TouchEvent](https://caniuse.com/#feat=touch), [ResizeObserver](https://caniuse.com/#feat=mdn-api_resizeobserver) on Edge Legacy

University example is 1 year behind on browser/OS versioning.

A first list of required features is:
- [CSS Variables](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-variables)
- [TouchEvent](https://caniuse.com/#feat=touch) or mouseEvents or [PointerEvents](https://caniuse.com/#feat=pointer)


Other compat. things to consider for codebase:
- JS compiled version

We'll need to test on different platforms that support is ok. 

## Action Items

Jiminy will go-on with his implementation of the new version of Jellybooks app, using the new shared model and navigator.

Juan will have a look at the shared models. Will also have a look at the PR for a sample mono-repo. 

Aferdita will help Jiminy looking at PaginatedBookView vs ScrolledBookView, the goal being to unify these views.
