## Discussion

### Notes

Everything currently on the root folder of the `web` repo has been moved to a `docs` folder. This includes the minutes of our calls + `_layouts` folder (if possible). Juan has done that. 

For the record: [Jellybooks repo, current pull request](https://github.com/Jellybooks/jbks-shared-web/pull/1)

Jiminy:  3 days ago and earlier today, PRs pushed on Github.  
- Shared models in Readium Web: https://github.com/readium/web/pull/3
- Navigator in JBKS fork: https://github.com/Jellybooks/web/pull/1

Shared models have to be validated first. 
The navigator is waiting for some feedback where it is. Complete reviews will be done when there is a PR on the readium/web space. 

Jiminy is integrating the navigator in the Jellybooks app; evolutions on the navigator may happen in // with the integration, if issues and improvments are found.

Aferdita thought before about unifying PaginatedBookView and ScrolledBookView, as the pagination comes from Readium CSS.  EPUB spreads may commplexify the issue again. 

Locators, dom range. Daniel now really thinks it is the best solution for selecting fragments of text (e.g. TTS with highlights on a para split btw two pages). 

For Aferdita also, CFI to dom range was used for highlighting text, even on mobile. The transform was complex but after that the manipulation was easy (even converting to CSS selector). So her fork contains an extension of the Locator including dom range. 

Mickaël agrees. Actually `domRange` is defined in https://readium.org/architecture/models/locators/extensions/html.html, as an object. Aferdita has checked that the implementation is interoperable btw at least iOS and Android (the highlight color was more of an issue in practice). Daniel will be able to add domRange to the Locator model without composition.  

Conclusion: on Readium Web the Locator mode can simply include the 3 properties related to HTML locators, i.e. cssSelector, domRange, partialCfi. The latter is not used for navigating but it is useful because if you have only a partialCfi (e.g. Readium 1 or Adobe or cfi source) it can be converted to another location type. 

## Action Items

Mickaël will have a look at shared models. 
Aferdita will have a look at PaginatedBookView vs ScrolledBookView.
