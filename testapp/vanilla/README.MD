# Test App for JS without a framework

This is an example of how to use the ts-toolkit. It's currently under construction, more features (preferences) will be added as the preferences API is added, otherwise you can inject them yourself, if you dare!

To run:

```sh
# Install dependencies
pnpm install
# Run the dev server
pnpm dev
```

You can then visit e.g. http://localhost:5173 in your browser. If you want to try out another book in the `./public/books` folder, you can change the book parameter, for example http://localhost:5173?book=bella . The default is `moby-dick`.
